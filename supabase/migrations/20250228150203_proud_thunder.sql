  # Fix permission errors in RLS policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Remove problematic admin role references
    - Fix policies that were causing permission errors
    - Simplify authentication checks
  2. Permissions
    - Update policies to use standard auth.uid() checks
    - Ensure proper access for authenticated users
